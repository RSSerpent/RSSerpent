Python \u00b6 RSSerpent is written in the Python programming language. You must have a valid Python installation on your system in order to get RSSerpent up & run. The most universal way to install Python is to grab a installer from the official Python download page . An alternative approach is to install via a package manager: Linux macOS Windows # Arch sudo pacman -S python # Debian/Ubuntu sudo apt update sudo apt install python3 python3-pip # Homebrew brew install python # MacPorts sudo port selfupdate sudo port install python # Chocolatey choco install python # Scoop scoop install python Note If you need to manage multiple versions of Python on your system, checkout pyenv . Note If you are using Windows, you will need to set the environment variable PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 . After successful installation, you need to run python -V (or python3 -V ) to verify the currently installed Python's version, as the default Python version provided by some package managers might not be compatible with RSSerpent. Please refer to the documentation of respective package manager to install a compatible Python version. Note Make sure you have git installed too.

If you are contributing to the RSSerpent core (or any existing RSerpent plugin project), read this tutorial to understand the general workflow. Fork \u00b6 Take the RSSerpent core for example: On GitHub, navigate to the repository of the project you want to contribute. Click the Fork button on the top-right corner to create a replicate of the original repository owned by yourself. Note Read GitHub's document to further understand forks. Install \u00b6 Clone your forked repository locally. In your terminal, use cd to enter the directory and run: poetry install poetry run pre-commit install -t pre-commit -t commit-msg This will install project dependencies as well as pre-commit hooks. Depending on your network connection, it may take up to several minutes to install project dependencies. Note Read GitHub's document to further understand cloning. It's recommended to use an SSH key (instead of password) to connect to GitHub. Read GitHub's this document on how to configure SSH keys. Branch \u00b6 In you local repository, create a new branch by running git checkout -b <branch name> . Do all you work on this branch, instead of the master (or main ) branch. This will keep your fork free of conflict with the original repository. Generally we use a different branch for each pull request. Note It's a convention to name your branch feat/xxx if you are working on a new feature, or fix/xxx if you are trying to fix a bug. Pull Request \u00b6 After you commit changes locally, you need to push these commits to the remote GitHub repository. For the first push on any branch, run git push -u origin <branch name> ; after that you can just run git push for convenience. After pushing, open the browser, navigate to your forked repository. You will see a Pull request button above the list of files. Click that button to create a pull request, so that you could submit your work to the original repository. The maintainer of the original repository will then decide whether or not to accept your pull request. Note Read GitHub's document to further understand pull requests. Further Steps \u00b6 So far this tutorial is focused on discussing the general workflow of contributing to the RSSerpent core. If you are looking for some specific problem to work on, you may: Skim through the list of issues/discussions, find something you are interested in, claim the issue/discussion, and then submit a pull request. Find a bug, create an issue to report the bug, and then if you can, submit a pull request that will resolve this issue. Come up with an idea of some new feature, create a discussion thread to see if the maintainer will accept this feature, and then if you can and the maintainer will, submit a pull request implementing this new feature.","title":"Core"},{"location":"contribution/core/#core","text":"Note Make sure you have read Environment before continuing.

Learn to create a RSSerpent plugin project from scratch through this tutorial. Scaffold \u00b6 You will need to install cookiecutter for quickly scaffolding an RSSerpent plugin, by using the official plugin template . pip install --user cookiecutter # or on macOS brew install cookiecutter # or on Debian/Ubuntu sudo apt install cookiecutter Now it's time to scaffold you project! In your terminal, start a new session and run: cookiecutter gh:rsserpent/template This will download the official RSSerpent plugin template from GitHub. You will then be prompted to fill in some information: plugin [rsserpent-plugin-xxx]: description [An rsserpent plugin for xxx.]: username [queensferryme]: link [https://github.com/queensferryme]: email [queensferryme@example.com]: The message between the brackets [...] are default values for respective fields, you may press Enter to accept or type in your own choice. You personal information ( email etc.) will only be used for rendering the template. You could always remain anonymous if you'd like to. After that, we'll automatically create a directory rsserpent-plugin-xxx/ with all the necessary project configurations for you. We will also install project dependencies (through poetry ) and pre-commit hooks, which may take minutes depending on your network connection. Develop \u00b6 You will need a IDE to start developing. We recommend using Visual Studio Code , or VSCode for short. Use VSCode to open the directory you just created using cookiecutter . You may be prompted to install some recommended VSCode plugins. An RSSerpent plugin is mostly a collection of routers , and each router is a path string accompanied by a data provider function. from typing import Any , Dict path = \"/path/to/route\" async def provider () -> Dict [ str , Any ]: return { \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"link\" : \"https://example.com\" , \"description\" : \"An example rsserpent plugin.\" , \"items\" : [{ \"title\" : \"Example Title\" , \"description\" : \"Example Description\" }], } Note See more example routers here . Warning The provider function must be async and can not have position-only arguments . The path variable defines an endpoint where users could access the RSS feed, and the provider function provides necessary data for rendering and serving the RSS feed to users. You will also need to register you routers in rsserpent_plugin_xxx/__init__.py : from . import route1 , route2 , route3 plugin = Plugin ( # ... routers = { route1 . path : route1 . provider , route2 . path : route2 . provider , route3 . path : route3 . provider , }, ) Note Poetry install dependencies inside a virtualenv . Therefore, in order to use tools like pre-commit , pytest or uvicorn , you will need to run poetry shell or source $(poetry env info -p)/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment. Run uvicorn --reload rsserpent:app in your terminal to start an RSSerpent instance locally, so that you can see if you plugin works as expected. \u279c uvicorn --reload rsserpent:app INFO: Will watch for changes in these directories: ['/path/to/your/directory'] INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit) INFO: Started reloader process [30920] using statreload INFO: Started server process [30922] INFO: Waiting for application startup. INFO: Application startup complete. Note We recommend plugin authors to write tests, so that the plugin can be more robust and have less bugs. Write your tests in the tests/ directory and run pytest to run the tests. Publish \u00b6 After you made enough changes to the plugin locally, make sure to commit your changes and push to GitHub. In this way, you can make you latest work available to plugin users. git add --all git commit -m \"<type>: <description>\" git push origin Note Commit messages should be in accordance with the Conventional Commits specification. When you run git commit , a set of pre-commit hooks will be triggered. Make sure you pass the checks before actually pushing to GitHub.

RSSerpent ships with convenient utility functions for you to retrieve data in various scenarios. HTTP \u00b6 The most basic, bare-bone way to retrieve data from the Internet is by using the HTTP protocol. HTTPX , a powerful HTTP library for Python with asynchronous API, is bundled with the RSSerpent core. Sometimes the source website has a directly accessible JSON API, so you can simply: from rsserpent.utils import HTTPClient async with HTTPClient () as client : response = await client . get ( \"https://httpbin.org/json\" ) data = response . json () Here, rsserpent.utils.HTTPClient is a subclass of httpx.AsyncClient , despite that HTTPClient will automatically set Host , Referer , and User-Agent headers for you. HTML \u00b6 The source website is sometimes not kind enough to offer you convenient JSON API, so you have to parse the HTML in order to retrieve data.

Many modern websites are loaded with JavaScript, and the true content of the website won't be rendered unless you are running in a genuine browser environment with a JavaScript engine. In this case, you need a browser emulator. Playwright is a powerful browser automation library and it's bundled with RSSerpent.

Proceed to the next chapter if you already understood. What is RSS? \u00b6 RSS , short for Really Simple Syndication, is a web feed format. Other common web feed formats include Atom , JSON Feed , etc. As the oldest and most popular web feed format, RSS is also often used as the collective name of RSS, Atom, and other web feed formats. As a web feed format, RSS is capable of pushing some frequently updated content to end-users over the Internet. One typical application of RSS is in the news industry. To this day, many news publishers, including BBC News, The Guardian, etc, still provide RSS news subscriptions. Why use RSS? \u00b6 RSS is most convenient for content readers. By subscribing to RSS feeds, you could aggregate information from various sources into one united place, thus eliminating the need to open multiple tabs/applications to skim through. What's even better, you can filter and prioritize based on the then aggregated information, in order to retrieve the most valuable pieces and save your precious reading time. Many RSS feeds also provide full-text output (instead of abstraction), so that you don't even have to open the browser to read the article. You will be free of cookie tracking, and your privacy will be preserved. However, RSS is not as friendly to content publishers. Because RSS does not require you to open a browser or accept tedious cookie policies, it will be increasingly difficult for content publishers to profit from advertisement and personal data. As a result, fewer and fewer content publishers provide RSS subscriptions nowadays. RSSerpent would like to change this situation, so that content readers can benefit from more independent, convenient, and free access to the information on the Internet. How to use RSS? \u00b6 Usually, you subscribe to an RSS feed with a link (URL). RSS subscription links, by default, generate data in formats (e.g. XML, JSON) that are easier for computers to process and exchange. Therefore, we will also need an RSS reader to convert the RSS feed format into a more human-readable format. Taking the RSS subscription link of The Guardian's World News as an example: By opening that subscription link in the browser, you are likely to be confronted with this incomprehensible document. Don't panic! You are not mandated to understand anything about computer programming in order to learn about how to use RSS \ud83d\ude09 The only thing you will need to know is the link in the browser's address bar. Copy that subscription link to your clipboard, open your RSS reader, paste that link, and you will successfully subscribe to the RSS feed. There are plenty of RSS readers available out there. You can find many of them simply through the search engine. The All about RSS repository also exhibits a fine collection of popular RSS readers for your reference.

For example, the subscription link of The Guardian World News' feed is www.theguardian.com/world/rss . In this subscription link, the part before the first slash / is called the domain ( www.theguardian.com ), and the other part is called the route ( /world/rss ). You can conceive of a subscription link as a virtual pathway, of which the domain is an approximate address while the route is the specific unit/room, etc. The subscription link leads you towards resources you need on the Internet. Note The definition of a subscription link here does not necessarily comply with the URL standard. There are simplifications so that readers from a non-tech background can understand more easily. Instances and Routes \u00b6 If you wish to subscribe to news sources without RSS through RSSerpent, you will need to find the subscription link, as usual. RSSerpent's subscription links, similarly, consist of a domain and a route: Every domain corresponds to an RSSerpent instance. For example, the official domain www.rsserpent.com corresponds to the official instance. You can find more official instances to use on the [Deploy] page, but we recommend self-hosting to accommodate your growing and varied requirements. By default, an RSSerpent instance contains no route. Maintainers of instances will need to [Install Plugins] to import routes. If you found a plugin/route missing while using an RSSerpent hosted by others, you can appeal to the instance maintainer or, as recommended, self-host an instance on your own. Note An instance is a running copy of the RSSerpent software. Note Every RSSerpent plugin contains one or more routes. RSSerpent's official instance comes with the Bilibili plugin . Therefore, you can access the /bilibili/user/{id}/video route on the official instance to subscribe to some users' published videos. For example, if you wish to subscribe to Chubbyemu 's official Chinese translation channel on Bilibili, you could concatenate the official domain www.rsserpent.com and the route /bilibili/user/297786973/video to generate the subscription link as follows: Route Parameters \u00b6 Warning Any example under this warning is provided \"as is\" and does not necessarily work with any instances. From the example given above, we note that some routes are not complete, and require your information input. Assuming this route can help you subscribe to some users' published videos, the route will need to know which users you'd like to subscribe to to work as expected. These information inputs are called route parameters . Route parameters are usually surrounded by brackets {} . When filling the route parameters, you should remove the bracket pair. Different routes are provided by different plugins, and you should refer to the documentation of the respective plugin to understand the implication of each route parameter and how you can find and fill in these route parameters. Again, taking the /bilibili/user/{id}/video route for example: the route accepts one route parameter id . Every Bilibili user is endowed with a unique ID, which you usually can find in the user profile's address. Only with this unique identifier, the route will then be able to retrieve the user's list of published videos, and output the list in the RSS feed subscription link. Query Parameters \u00b6 Route parameters are required. However, sometimes routes need to access optional or conditional parameters -- we call such parameters query parameters : Query parameters should be placed after the route, and guarded by a question mark ? ; There can be arbitrary amount of query parameters, each looking like {name}={value} ; Multiple query parameters are separated with an ampersand & . For example, assuming the /bilibili/user/{id}/video route accepts two query parameters, of which the sort parameter is used to specify the sorting criteria while the order parameter is used to indicate ascent/descent. Given that most users would probably subscribe to the latest videos, the route by default will sort the list of videos in chronologically descending order.
