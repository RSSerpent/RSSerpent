Python \u00b6 RSSerpent is written in the Python programming language. You must have a valid Python installation on your system in order to get RSSerpent up & run. The most universal way to install Python is to grab a installer from the official Python download page . An alternative approach is to install via a package manager: Linux macOS Windows # Arch sudo pacman -S python # Debian/Ubuntu sudo apt update sudo apt install python3 python3-pip # Homebrew brew install python # MacPorts sudo port selfupdate sudo port install python # Chocolatey choco install python # Scoop scoop install python Note If you need to manage multiple versions of Python on your system, checkout pyenv . Note If you are using Windows, you will need to set the environment variable PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 . After successful installation, you need to run python -V (or python3 -V ) to verify the currently installed Python's version, as the default Python version provided by some package managers might not be compatible with RSSerpent. Please refer to the documentation of respective package manager to install a compatible Python version. Note Make sure you have git installed too.

RSSerpent ships with convenient utility functions for you to retrieve data in various scenarios. HTTP \u00b6 The most basic, bare-bone way to retrieve data from the Internet is by using the HTTP protocol. HTTPX , a powerful HTTP library for Python with asynchronous API, is bundled with the RSSerpent core. Sometimes the source website has a directly accessible JSON API, so you can simply: from rsserpent.utils import HTTPClient async with HTTPClient () as client : response = await client . get ( \"https://httpbin.org/json\" ) data = response . json () Here, rsserpent.utils.HTTPClient is a subclass of httpx.AsyncClient , despite that HTTPClient will automatically set Host , Referer , and User-Agent headers for you. HTML \u00b6 The source website is sometimes not kind enough to offer you convenient JSON API, so you have to parse the HTML in order to retrieve data. PyQuery is here to help -- it lets you retrieve data from HTML documents by using a jQuery-like API, and it is also bundled with RSSerpent! from pyquery import PyQuery from rsserpent.utils import HTTPClient async with HTTPClient () as client : response = await client . get ( \"https://httpbin.org/json\" ) dom = PyQuery ( response . text ) title = dom ( \"h1\" ) . text () description = dom ( \"div > p\" ) . text () Browser Emulation \u00b6 In worse situations, HTTP is simply not enough. Many modern websites are loaded with JavaScript, and the true content of the website won't be rendered unless you are running in a genuine browser environment with a JavaScript engine. In this case, you need a browser emulator. Playwright is a powerful browser automation library and it's bundled with RSSerpent. RSSerpent also provides a convenient wrapper on top of playwright: from pyquery import PyQuery from rsserpent.utils import Browser async with Browser () as browser : await browser . goto ( \"https://httpbin.org/html\" ) content = await browser . content () dom = PyQuery ( content ) title = dom ( \"h1\" ) . text () description = dom ( \"div > p\" ) . text () Warning Browser emulation's power comes with a cost, as it strains CPU & memory resources. Be cautious! Use browser emulation only when necessary.","title":"Retrieving Data"},{"location":"contribution/plugin/data/#retrieving-data","text":"When you are writing a data provider function, you need to retrieve data from a source website.
