# Deploy with Vercel

Learn to self-host an RSSerpent instance on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (for *free*) through this tutorial.

## Use the Template

Go to the RSSerpent Vercel deployment [template](https://github.com/RSSerpent/rsserpent-deploy-vercel), then click the [![Template Button](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rsserpent/asset@latest/template-button.png)](https://github.com/RSSerpent/rsserpent-deploy-vercel/generate) button. You will be prompted to create a repository based on the template.

## Deploy the Project

Open this [link](https://vercel.com/new) in your browser, click *Continue with GitHub*. Vercel will instruct you to authenticate with your GitHub account. After successful login, Vercel will ask you to import a GitHub repository to deploy. You will need to find the `rsserpent-deploy-vercel` repository that you just created, and then click the ![Vercel Import Repository Button](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rsserpent/asset@latest/vercel-import-repo-button.png) button to its right.

Now, Vercel will ask you to configure the project. The good news is you don't have to! Just click the *Deploy* button, wait for several minutes, and your RSSerpent instance will be online.

## Running 🎉

If your interface now looks like this, congratulations, you are good to go! You can access your RSSerpent instance from the browser by clicking the website thumbnail in the center.
